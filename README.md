Twatter

Twatter is a library of some "useful" functions that you may want to use when playing with Twython.

This is very much a work in progress, and more of a learning project for me than anything. It's likely that you will find a number of errors and/or better ways to do things. The wiki for the project will contain more complete documentation, and will be updated as this project develops.
