tw.py
-----
This builds up location stats about followers of a user. Simply give it the username, and run it. It'll build up a dictionary of locations:number.

tw_freq.py
----------
This calculates the rate of tweets per minute for the given keywords (could be hashtags, for example), and alert you if that frequency breaks a threshold. The cycle will repeat as often as the user defines, with a user-defined threshold and waiting time between each cycle. Some aspects of this need work, including date/time stuff.

Notes
-----
Both pieces of code are shoddy and should be avoided if you're anything above a novice programmer. I will work on laying them out better, and improving them.
